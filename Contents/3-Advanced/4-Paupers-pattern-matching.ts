/**
 * Alas, this is the closest Iâ€™ve been able to get to functional
 * pattern matching in TypeScript. Practically speaking, there are few
 * advantages to this implementation over traditional if/else-based
 * type narrowing. The only one of note is that it enforces a specific
 * flow akin to case blocks, but without the break/flow-through
 * footgun.
 * 
 * TC39 is working on a language-level implementation of pattern
 * matching here:
 * 
 * https://github.com/tc39/proposal-pattern-matching
 * 
 * If adopted, TypeScript will probably follow suit and it should all
 * just work at the syntax level. (Fingers crossed.)
